This is my first attempt, with [Duality](https://github.com/a-newhouse/Duality), to make a fully functional keyboard from A to Z. 
# Schematic
To start with, I knew I wanted to use an RP2040 and per key LEDs. So I searched how to make an RP2040 board amd i found a book made by Raberry PI called the [Hardware design with RP2040: Using RP2040 microcontrollers to build boards and products](./Schematic_&_PCB/Hardware_Design_RP2040.pdf). This book contains alot of information on how to make a RP2040 development board.
