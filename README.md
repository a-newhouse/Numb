This is my first attempt, with [Duality](https://github.com/a-newhouse/Duality), to make a fully functional keyboard from A to Z. 
# Schematic
I based my design of the [Hardware design with RP2040: Using RP2040 microcontrollers to build boards and products](./Schematic_&_PCB/Hardware_Design_RP2040.pdf).
